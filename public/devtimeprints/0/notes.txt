Yes. I really spent 13 consecutive hours programming and I think the total rest time was no more than 40 minutes
 (this time is not editing or AFK time). my eyes are a little tired and I feel kind of weak. 
 Just yesterday I worked on this project about 4-5 hours before bed, 
 so I basically have 18 hours of project in less than 24 hours.
  Now I'm going to push it, put the PC to do Bing tasks 
  and go rest so I don't faint and have a heart attack
