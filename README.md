<h2 align="center">About Vex IA</h2>
<img src="./images/vex.png" width="150" height="150" align="right">
<li>This is an AI I've been building since 2019. It was an Android app made in Java. I had a lot of problems implementing features, mainly machine learning and problems with the play store (it took time to grow, politics and such). So one day I decided to create a version with React and NodeJS(so it's still under construction ), with the aim of creating an AI capable of having a normal conversation with a person and talking about games and various subjects... and who knows... becoming a conscious AI(⊙_⊙) </li>

The Vex is currently hosted on netlify. Try it right now (under construction). Say "hi" to her ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
