An ever-evolving artificial intelligence project since 2019. Initially developed as an Android app in Java, I faced challenges implementing advanced machine learning features.

So I decided to create a new version using React and NodeJS and do all the AI part on the back end (excuse my intelligence).

The purpose of Vex AI is to create an artificial intelligence capable of holding normal conversations and discussing games and various interesting subjects and who knows, maybe even becoming a conscious AI (âŠ™_âŠ™).

I'm excited to explore the limits of AI and share my progress on this journey. Join me on this exciting journey into the future of artificial intelligence!

<br>

**Note:** Vex is under active development. Stay tuned for future updates!

The Vex AI is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vexxx.vercel.app/enUS). You can try it out (under construction) by saying "hi" to her â•°(_Â´ï¸¶`_)â•¯â™¡
