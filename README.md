  <p align="justify">
    Welcome to the VexAI project! An ever-evolving artificial intelligence project since 2019. Initially developed as an Android app in Java, I faced challenges implementing advanced machine learning features. 
  <br><br>
    So I decided to create a new version using React and NodeJS and do all the AI part on the back end (excuse my intelligence). 
 <br><br>
    The purpose of VexAI is to create an artificial intelligence capable of holding normal conversations and discussing games and various interesting subjects and who knows, maybe even becoming a conscious AI (⊙_⊙). 
 <br><br>
    I'm excited to explore the limits of AI and share my progress on this journey. Join me on this exciting journey into the future of artificial intelligence!

  Note: Vex is under active development. Stay tuned for future updates!
  
  The Vex AI is currently hosted on Netlify. You can try it out (under construction) by saying "hi" to her ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
